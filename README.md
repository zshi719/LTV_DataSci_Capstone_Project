# Time Series Prediction & Comparison of Covid-19 Confirmed Cases in 2020 in Two Regions of the U.S.

## Purpose of This Project
.....

## Methodologies Employed
We each built these following 6 models to forecast the time series prediction for the NE and S regions:
- ARIMA 
- Auto-ARIMA
- Prophet Single Regressor
- Prophet Multiple Regressor
- XGBoost
- LSTM

## Layout of Github Repo
Our GitHub repo is categorized into the following directories:
- data: This folder contains the train and test data for the NE and S regions, as well as the original raw data zip
- eda: This folder contains exploratory data analysis performed on the train data
- models: This folder contains 6 sub-folders for all the models built
- preprocessing: This folder contains data preprocessing steps performed on the train data
- weekly_report: This folder contains all weekly reports

## Specific Instructions to Run Code
- To run any code that utilizes the original raw data file, user must UNZIP the original raw data in its directory first
- Each folder contains "old_ver" sub folder, which consists of older/unused work that we ran
